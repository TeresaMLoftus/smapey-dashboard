### Notes and Caveats
Here is a selection of notes and caveats from the user guidance tab:

* Take up: Population estimates at lower geographic levels, such as local authority, are subject to a greater degree of error. In some cases, local authority take-up rates can exceed 100%. Therefore, take-up rates at local authority level should be treated with more caution than national take-up rates.
* Take up of three and four year olds only considers universal funded early education (first 15 hours).
* EYFSP/Take up: Statistical Neighbour ranks are out of 11, they include the local authority selected and its ten nearest statistical neighbours.
* EYFSP/Take up: National rank is out of all authorities (152), but note some local authorities may have data suppressed or equal to zero.
