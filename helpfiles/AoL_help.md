### Notes and Caveats
Here is a selection of notes and caveats from the user guidance tab:

* EYFSP: The gap calculations were made using unrounded data held by DfE. In a small number of instances there may be a small difference in calculating the gaps using published data due to using rounded data.
* EYFSP: Children achieving at least the expected level in the ELGs within the three prime areas of learning and within literacy and mathematics is classed as achieving a 'good level of development'
* EYFSP: All other: Includes pupils not eligible for free school meals and for whom free school meal eligibility was unclassified or could not be determined
* EYFSP: Achieved at least the expected level in communication & language and literacy are those children who achieved "expected" or "exceeded" in the following early learning goals: listening and attention, understanding, speaking, reading and writing. 
* EYFSP/Take up: Statistical Neighbour ranks are out of 11, they include the local authority selected and its ten nearest statistical neighbours.
* EYFSP/Take up: National rank is out of all authorities (152), but note some local authorities may have data suppressed or equal to zero.
